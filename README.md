# RESUME-SCREENING-

Resume screening is the process of reviewing a resume to determine if the candidate is qualified for the position.
It’s one part of the larger pre-employment screening process. 
The decision of whether the candidate is qualified or not is based on education, experience, skills, and any other relevant information that may appear on the resume.
The hiring process can get messy though, especially when you’re using multiple platforms to post
It becomes very difficult for the hiring teams to read the resume and select the resume according to the requirement, there is no problem if there are one or two resumes but it is very difficult to go through 1000’s resumes and select the best one.
To solve this problem, the company can start the work of the resume screen itself by using a machine learning algorithm.
